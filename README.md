# About BikeShare
This repository contains a data exploration project for a bike share company, with the goal of increasing user numbers. The project includes an analysis of the company's current users, including their usage patterns and preferences. Based on the findings of this analysis, several recommendations are made for how the company can convert casual users into members or pass holders, and increase overall user numbers. These recommendations include offering tourist passes, launching a social media campaign targeting summer months, collaborating with local businesses to offer discounts to bike share users, and conducting further data analysis to better understand the needs and habits of casual users. The project concludes with a discussion of next steps for the company to continue growing and improving its services.
